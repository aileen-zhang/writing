&emsp;&emsp;how far will you  
&emsp;careen from your warm cradle?<!--more--> cold  
&emsp;and cruel is the black stranglehold  
of dark. pray tell me, is it true  


that still you think yourself aloof,  
&emsp;immune to loneliness, unfazed  
&emsp;by whipping winds that strip and flay?  
it must be so: when gripped by youth,  


your neighbor is a stranger, closed  
&emsp;to your interrogation. “strength  
&emsp;lies in belying your great warmth.”  
(this fib becomes the oldest ghost  


that haunts you.) distance only grows  
&emsp;out here in space; you'll flare, expand  
&emsp;with fusion, and then wither, damned  
to shrink until you bloat and go  


unquietly into that good  
&emsp;night. no one seeks your mid-life calm.  
&emsp;they're drawn to spectacle. the dumb-  
struck watchers of the guest star took  


explosion as a sign. of what?  
&emsp;you cannot say. ignore them: your  
&emsp;fires cry aloud. your stellar forge  
glows ravenous for matter, sought  


in unabatingly concealed  
&emsp;and dusty corners. eat your fill.  
&emsp;when else to savor the bright thrill  
of nebular rebirth? reveal  


your brilliant birthright. stupefy  
&emsp;the earth with roaring blue. unfurl  
&emsp;coronal arced ejecta. curl  
a field that cannot be denied.
