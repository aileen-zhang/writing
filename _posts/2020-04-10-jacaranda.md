a shadow of jacaranda blossoms in soggy grass.  
when I look again, there is nothing purple.<!--more--> sad stalks squish brown and yellow.  
when I step onto the path, I leave no watery footprint. it is as if I am a ghost,  

and I see the ghastly strangled blossoms because I too have wilted  
in a season not my own, under a sunrise not my own, with a name not my own.  
cobbles rise up to meet me on my night walks. dawn bends down with its light,  

its half-light. the purple blossoms are not in the trees this late in the year,   
but somehow I know where each one bloomed,   
where next year’s swollen heads will burst from bud.

## in the half-light, the only light

jacaranda purple glints in the shadows  
but it’s gone when I look again.  
sad stalks squish brown and yellow  
in the grass that takes no print.  

I float like a ghost these rainy nights  
over rough paths cobbled and cold.  
not even daybreak’s partial light  
reassures me my name is my own.  

I know the purple blooms are gone  
from the trees this late in the year.  
yet I know where each one  
was and where spring’s buds will appear.
