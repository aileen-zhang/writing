Sixteenth of August: twenty times I have  
paused, pondered, passed. This year is much the same.  
<!--more-->
Familiar meteors aflame above.  
Below I lay unsettled, strange, profane.  
Since we last met, I've seen the magical:  
a love revived, a self remade. A song  
has taken root and flowered, radicles  
drilled deep into my heart, blooms opened long  
and lush. Its current shakes me. I could wait  
for it to sweep me downstream and away  
from that which ails me, succumb to my fate.  
But I am loath to go. I brave the days  
I needn't fear. I once cowered at chance.  
Today, I sing along. I learn to dance.
