a wave arches its back against the sea cave within me,  
trembles its coral walls, roars through it end to end.<!--more-->  
soft flotsam batters the living stone that girds it.  

what drives its pummeling force? unchangeable tides  
decreed from far above. all I can do is wring my hands  
to weather the roilâ€”a useless act against the churn.  

I have polluted the cave and it demands to be clean.  
inside me, a great groaning. I watch the wave arc out,  
run down the sides of the ceramic bowl, and disappear.
