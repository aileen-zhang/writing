The common supermarket strawberry  
is a monstrous fruit, engorged and studded<!--more-->  
with seeds, heavy enough to really pack a punch  
if you'd turn it projectile. Its meat is sweet as  
anything, as sweet as romance-novel love,  

as sweet as syrup chugged straight  
from the bottle. But you get used to it,  
this gory, so-called berry, and you get so used  
to its perfectly sweet flesh that when you  
stumble upon its wild cousin, you  

hardly know what to do with its prim  
yellow flowers and its miniature spiky fruit  
hiding under the tall grasses that are too decorative  
to cut. The Indian strawberry doesn't taste  
like anything at all, much less what  

you'd expect from such a neat package  
of such a rich red. And I guess what I've learned  
from nibbling them on the solitary walk back home  
is not a lesson in love or disappointment or  
the vapid fancy of candles and roses  

but what monsters our favorites can be.
