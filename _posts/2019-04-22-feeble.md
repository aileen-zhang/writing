along the way, you have forgotten that  
the earth is just as vast as the heavens.  
<!--more-->
These soils are steeped in story, bulging fat  
with notions so strange and old not even  
the wisest man could unearth them all. Much  
unmined lore lies beneath your witless feet.  
Yet you stand still, relying on your crutch  
of pretty pictures, empty head replete  
with silent color, tasteless sound, weightless  
like soap bubbles in shadow. Do not fear  
that which you do not understand. Digress  
to hidden places both distant and near.  
For lines that strike stronger, fly longer, soar;  
journey beyond lands known and mapped before.
